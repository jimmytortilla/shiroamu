# The Strattons in Japan

This [website](https://jimmytortilla.github.io/shiroamu/) is a [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) generated site that I put together as a church website.  Like our [stratton.life](https://stratton.life) site, I used the HUGO theme [Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/), which is under an MIT license.
